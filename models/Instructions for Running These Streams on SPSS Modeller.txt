Blood Bank Transfusion Service Center

The initial file downloaded for the UCI Machine Learning Repository was named "Blood Transfusion Service Center." 
The link for the original source of the data is http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/blood-transfusion/


We named the downloaded version of this data "transfusion.txt."


There are 4 streams, one for each classification model type. 
They are named: annadvance.str, bayesian.str, decisiontree.str, and SVM.str. All four were used for training, and the 
final test was run on the decisiontree.str. 


When you first open each stream on a new computer, you will need to tell the computer where to find the data file. 
You do this by double clicking the external file node in the stream (labeled transfusion.txt). 
A dialogue box will appear. In the dialogue box in the File Tab, set the import file location to the file on your computer 
(the file is also named transfusion.txt). Then select the Type Tab in the same dialogue box.  Select "Clear Values," "Read Values," apply, OK. 
You are now ready to use the stream.


To run the stream, press the green triangle button labeled "Run The Current Stream" from the menu bar above the canvas. 
This will update all the gem node with the information created during that run of the models. 
To only run one specific model, double click that model hexagon and select Run.
